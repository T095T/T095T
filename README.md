🔷 building from zero

i enjoy building systems from scratch — designing the frontend, structuring the backend, modeling data, and deploying applications. i care more about shipping usable products and learning through iteration than chasing trends.

🔷 currently exploring

- advanced next.js patterns and performance optimization  
- system design fundamentals for scalable applications  
- database modeling and query optimization  
- production-ready ai integrations in full-stack products
