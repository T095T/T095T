🔷 my latest projects  

[HiveMind](https://github.com/T095T/hivemind) — real-time collaborative canvas for brainstorming and ideation. built to understand how modern collaboration tools handle shared state and low-latency updates. supports live cursors, synchronized canvas actions, and multi-user presence. focuses on real-time UX, scalability, and clean system design.  
built with next.js, typescript, liveblocks, fabric.js, and tailwind css.

[Skooly](https://github.com/T095T/skooly) — education-focused web platform aimed at simplifying learning workflows and content interaction. designed with a strong focus on clean UI, modular components, and usability. structured to scale for real-world ed-tech scenarios rather than just demos.  
built with react, next.js, javascript, and tailwind css.

[Nexara](https://github.com/T095T/nexara) — ai-powered mock interview platform that simulates realistic interview experiences for students and freshers. integrates ai agents to drive interview flow, follow-up questions, and responses. focuses on smooth user experience, authentication, and interview realism.  
built with next.js, tailwind css, firebase, and ai apis.

[NoteCraft](https://github.com/T095T/notecraft) — lightweight desktop application for fast and distraction-free markdown note taking. designed for developers who prefer local-first tools and minimal interfaces. emphasizes performance, keyboard-driven workflows, and simplicity over feature bloat.  
built with electron, react, and typescript.

[Smart Surveillance and Crime Detection Using AI](https://github.com/T095T/smart-surveillance-ai) — computer vision–based surveillance system for detecting suspicious or criminal activities from video streams. focuses on anomaly detection, video processing, and real-world security use cases. built as an end-to-end ai pipeline from data processing to detection.  
built with python, opencv, and machine learning models.

🔷 building from zero  
i enjoy building systems from scratch — designing the frontend, structuring the backend, modeling data, and deploying applications. i care more about shipping usable products and learning through iteration than chasing trends or overengineering.

🔷 notable focus areas  
full-stack development — building complete applications end to end.  
real-time systems — collaboration, shared state, and low-latency updates.  
ai integration — applying ai where it provides real value.  
clean architecture — writing maintainable and scalable code.

🔷 currently exploring  
advanced next.js patterns and performance optimization.  
system design fundamentals for scalable applications.  
database modeling and query optimization.  
production-ready ai integrations in full-stack products.
