# Pranav (T095T)

Full-Stack Developer focused on building clean, scalable, and practical web applications.  
I enjoy working across the stack — from designing intuitive user interfaces to building robust backend systems and integrating AI where it adds real value.

Currently exploring better system design, real-time applications, and production-level frontend and backend patterns.
