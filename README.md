🔷 building from zero
i like building things from scratch. from designing the frontend, structuring the backend, wiring databases, to deploying and iterating based on feedback. i care more about shipping usable products than debating tools. learning by building is my default mode.

🔷 notable focus areas
full-stack development — designing and implementing complete web applications end to end.
real-time systems — collaboration, shared state, and low-latency updates.
ai integration — using ai where it adds value, not just for the buzz.
clean architecture — writing maintainable code that scales with the project.

🔷 currently exploring
advanced next.js patterns and performance optimization.
system design fundamentals for scalable web apps.
better database modeling and query optimization.
production-ready ai integrations in full-stack products.
