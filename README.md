🔷 building from zero

I enjoy building systems from scratch , designing the frontend, structuring the backend, modeling data, and deploying applications. I work across the entire development lifecycle. From UI/UX to deployment to user feedback, I care less about technology debates and more about delivering results that people love using.

🔷 currently exploring

- advanced next.js patterns and performance optimization  
- system design fundamentals for scalable applications  
- database modeling and query optimization  
- production-ready ai integrations in full-stack products
